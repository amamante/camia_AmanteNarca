# Project Description
- Have you ever experienced being drowned in what seems to be an infinite pile of schoolworks that you start thinking all the decisions you made in the past which lead you to where you right now? Truthfully, as students, it really cannot be avoided. There are some moments that you feel the need to sort out the subjects you "must" focus on more compared to another subject, choosing to "sacrifice" the latter just to handle the tormer. Sorting things out can, at times, come in hand and be useful in tackling everyday issues. In addition to that, have you ever experienced being lost and having no idea on where to start? Luckily, Python's the one for you. Due to realistic adversities we face day-to-day as aspiring scholars, we have formulated the idea to design a Python program which solves this problem; since we figured that it deals with a function that, well, sorts out elements and items. In our program, we aim to provide the necessary content by making a program that acts like a to-do list tracker to organize requirements and checks it. For us to minimize the hassle of carrying pens and papers just to cross out the schoolworks that we have finished, why not simply encode it conventionally into our smartphone? This way, we can maximize our time into focusing on our schoolworks--to get the job done.

## Features
-   This program will act as an active to-do list tracker.
-   The user will be asked to decide if they want to add/input a task, delete a task, or to exit the program.
-   Displays tasks (to-be-done, completed, future, or all tasks).
-   Deleting a task removes it from the list. allowed to assign priority levels to tasks.
-   Users are allowed to set due dates to track the deadlines of each task.

## How To Run The Program
1.    Make sure you have Python installed.
2.    Download the file 'list_tracker.py
3.    Open a terminal or command prompt.
4.    Follow the on-screen instructions. Make sure to input all the necessary information the program asked for before running the program to avoid error(s).
5.    Run the program by clicking 'Run' or pressing F5
